## 🔭 The Holoscope (Visualization)

**Don't just read the data. See the organism.**

Malachite includes a physics-based rendering engine that generates an interactive 3D map of the civilization's metabolism. It visualizes the flow of Matter (Orange), Energy (Red), and Knowledge (Blue).

## 🌍 Mission

**Malachite** is not just a database of facts. It is a digital model of the **Technosphere**, designed to teach Artificial Intelligence the causal links between:
*   **Resources** (What we have)
*   **Science** (What is possible)
*   **Technology** (How to build)
*   **Society** (Why we need it)

This repository provides the **"Hard Skills"** (Memory & Logic) for the Global Intelligence.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system is built on the **"Start Flat, Grow Deep"** principle.

### 1. The 8 Fundamental Domains
The world is mapped into a strict directory structure (`data_v2/`):
*   **`01_SCIENCE`**: Laws, Axioms, and Effects.
*   **`02_DESIGN`**: Standards, Code, and Methodologies.
*   **`03_RESOURCES`**: Raw Matter (Ores, Energy, Biosphere).
*   **`04_MATERIALS`**: Processed Matter (Alloys, Polymers).
*   **`05_INFRASTRUCTURE`**: Tools, Factories, Power Plants.
*   **`06_PROCESSES`**: Technologies (Verbs: Casting, Coding).
*   **`07_ARTIFACTS`**: Products (The Goal).
*   **`08_SOCIETY`**: Context, History, and Needs.

### 2. Generative Core
Data is not entered manually. It is grown by Python simulators located in `_generators/`. This ensures physical consistency across thousands of objects.

---

## 🧠 The Syntropy Engine

The repository includes a logic core (`_generators/syntropy_engine.py`) that evaluates every object based on the **Law of Syntropy**:

$$ S = \frac{E_{acc} - E_{cost}}{E_{create}} $$

*   **Syntropy Score ($S$):** Energy Efficiency. (>1.0 = Good).
*   **Catalytic Potential ($C$):** Information Leverage.
*   **Verdict:** The system automatically tags objects as `HERO`, `INVEST`, `BAN`, or `SIMULATE`.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Initialize Structure
Create the folder skeleton (The "Shelves").
```bash
python init_genesis.py
```

### 2. Seed the World (Simulation)
Launch the factory to generate 5,000+ objects with calculated physics.
```bash
python run_all_seeds.py
```

### 3. Validate Chains
Check if all supply chains are physically possible (no missing resources).
```bash
python _generators/validate_supply_chains.py
```

### 4. Analyze Syntropy
Run the "Judge" to evaluate the energy efficiency of the civilization.
```bash
python _generators/analyze_syntropy.py
```

## 🤝 Contributing

1.  **Do not edit `index.csv` manually** if a generator exists. Update the generator logic instead.
2.  **Respect the Era:** Do not introduce Digital tech in the Primitive Era.
3.  **Check Syntropy:** If your addition increases Entropy without Catalytic Potential, it will be rejected by the Judge.
